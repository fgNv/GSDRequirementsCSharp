# GSDRequirementsCSharp

GSD stands for Global Software Development.

This project aims to support software teams which have members splitted among countries to organize the projects artifacts (mainly requirements), 
and enable adding translations for them, making data easily accessible for all the collaborators of the projects, independently of their knowledge of foreign languages.
